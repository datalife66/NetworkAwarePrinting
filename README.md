# NetworkAwarePrinting
Version 3.9

Microsoft did not include Location Aware Printing in windows 10.

Network Aware Printing brings that functionality back.

Unlike Location Aware Printing, Network Aware Printing will alert you to choose a new default printer when a new network has been detected..

You then "set it and forget it". Network Aware Printing will switch default printers in the background.
